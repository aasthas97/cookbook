It seems like a lifetime away that I was writing down fantasy story ideas to share with you. Somewhere between detailing systems of magic and determining the perfect ingredients for a recipe, we grew up. And honestly as that was happening, the fact that life could change in any discernible way just seemed unfathomable. Do you remember discussing for a brief period how you might take up commerce to become a CA? It was a wake-up call for me and I spent many subsequent summers trying to envision life without you. Lucky for me, you didn’t study commerce and I’ve never really had to find out what life feels like without you a heartbeat away.
For 5 years, we’ve survived different colleges, different states and different countries. The journey has been frustrating, comforting, overwhelming, inspiring, ugly and so so breathtaking all at once. Somehow, I find cooking to be a very similar process and I hope to be there for you, with you, every step of the way as you cook and as you navigate life. I love you Shrutika Jha and you will always have a piece of my heart.
